What is Ray Tracing? What, what, what? Ray tracing is a technique for rendering three-dimensional 
graphics with very complex light interactions! This means you can create pictures 
full of mirrors, transparent surfaces, and shadows, with stunning results. We discuss 
ray tracing in this introductory graphics article because it is a very simple method to 
both understand and implement. So the color of each point on real film is caused 
by a light ray (actually, a group of rays) that passes through the aperture and 
hits the film, while in computer graphics each pixel of the final image is caused 
by a simulated light ray that hits the view window on its path towards the eye. 
The results, however, are the same. We subdivide the view window into small squares, 
where each square corresponds to one pixel in the final image. If you want to create 
an image at the resolution of 640x400, you would break up the view window into a 
grid of 640 squares across and 400 square down. The real problem, then, is assigning 
a color to each square. This is what ray tracing does.
